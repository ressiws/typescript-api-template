⚠️ This is an opinionated TypeScript API template.

Feature requests that significantly increase complexity, add heavy dependencies,
or change the architectural direction (e.g. GraphQL, ORMs, framework swaps)
may be declined without discussion.

---

**What problem does this solve in the context of this template?**
Explain why this is relevant for a minimal API base, not for a full framework.

**Why should this live in the template instead of user-land?**
Explain why this cannot be implemented by users themselves after setup.

**What is the impact on complexity and dependencies?**
List new packages, configuration changes, or additional maintenance burden.

**Can this be optional without affecting existing users?**
If yes, explain how. If not, justify why breaking changes are acceptable.

**Additional context (code or logs only)**
Avoid screenshots. Keep it technical and concise.
